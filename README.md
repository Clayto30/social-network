# Social Network

## Description 

A social media startup needs an API for their social network, using a NoSQL database, so I have created this repo to satisfy that request. 

This database can handle large amounts of unstructured data with flexibility and quickness. It will also satisfy the social media startup's technical acceptance requirements for their user stories. Users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list.

I have accomplished the goals of the social media startup by using Mongoose and Express to set up API routes.

## Installation

Clone the repo onto your local device. At the root folder, run npm init in order to include the dependencies. Please have mongo db installed. You will be ready to run wild with my api routes and database!

## Usage 

Enter the command 'npm start' in invoke the application. The server starts and the Mongoose models will be synced to the MongoDB database.

You can use an app like Insomnia Core to test the api routes for users and thoughts. You can run all CRUD routes on these models. The data will be displayed and formatted as JSON.
